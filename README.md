# How to Contribute a New Widget

There are **two ways** to contribute:

1. **Direct Contribution:**
  - Add your widget directly to this repository under `Widgets/community/<your_widget_id>` (simplest) by forking this repository. Create and maintain your widgets in your fork, and make a pull request to the main repository to update your widget in the hub.

2. **External Repository:**
  - Maintain your own repository and link it to this repository by adding a git submodule.
    - Fork this repository and add a git submodule to your own repository, then create a PR to add your submodule to the hub.
    - **Note:** If you have multiple widgets in the same repository, *each update* will require *all* widgets to be approved at the same time, which can slow down the process.

# Required Widget Structure

```
<your_widget_id>/
  ├─ <your_widget_id>.lua   # Main widget code
  ├─ cover.png              # PNG image (~400x400) showcasing your widget
  ├─ README.md              # Detailed explanation of your widget
  ├─ manifest.json          # Technical data about your widget (see below)
  └─ <other_files_allowed_up_to_a_point> # You are not limited to a single file, but try to keep it within reason
```

The widget directory name is the widget ID. It must be globally unique, lower snake case, and include a scope prefix such as `gui_`, `cmd_`, `unit_`, or `map_`. The `id` in `manifest.json` must match this directory name exactly, for example `gui_lower_snake_case`.

Each widget directory must stay under 5 MiB.


## manifest.json

Ensure your `id` is globally unique, has a scope prefix, and matches the root directory of the widget. Avoid using common or generic IDs.

Your `manifest.json` must include the following fields:

```json
{
  "id": "<your_widget_id>",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "display_name": "A Pretty Display Name",
  "author": "YourUserName",
  "discord_link": "https://discord.com/channels/12345/12345",
  "github_link": "https://github.com/beyond-all-reason/Beyond-All-Reason/pull/5309",
  "description": "A SHORT description that summarizes your widget.",
  "last_updated": "2026-01-01T00:00:00.000Z"
}
```

The `last_updated` field is an ISO 8601 timestamp used to sort widgets by recency. Update it whenever you publish a new version.

## Verify

It is recommended to verify your widget by running `docker compose --profile=tool run --rm builder` before submitting a PR.
